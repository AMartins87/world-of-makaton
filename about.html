            <p> Today over 100,000 children and adults use Makaton symbols and signs, either as their main method of
                communication or as a way to support speech. Makaton signs are based on the gestures used in British
                Sign Language – the language of the Deaf community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Using signs can help children who are non-verbal due to communication difficulties or
                because they are little babies/toddlers. Signing can help little children express
                themselves during this time and prevent or alleviate their frustrations caused by their current
                inability to communicate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of you may have come across Makaton signing, for example while watching TV programme <a
                    class="extlink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/shows/something-special"

                    Special</a> on CBeebies. Mr Tumbles is a favorite staple in many families with young children. It
                is a good starting point as it will give you a taster of what Makaton is about and you can learn it in a
                form of play altogether.</p>

                <li>Use signs and symbols as much and as often as you can. Don't be shy! Your signing doesn't have

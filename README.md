The purpose of the World of Makaton website is to introduce more people to this wonderful and easy sign language which supports children and adults who may have learning difficulties and/or delays, to communicate better.

World of Makaton gives the user just enough information to get to know this form of communication and it gives some external pointers if they would like to know more about the background of it.

<strong>TESTING</strong>

------
info for me: In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h2><strong>VALIDATOR TESTING</strong></h2>

inc links to the validators to prove it

    > HTML (No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator) 
    > CSS (No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator)

Unfixed Bugs
------
info for me : You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
------

Deployment
------
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

<h2><strong>CREDITS</strong></h2>
------
In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

<h2><strong>BUGS</strong></h2>

Right at the beginning my page wasn't loading all the style changes. I realised I forgot to link the style.css file with the index.html file. Once I linked it, all was fixed.
I added the meta keywords and names at that time as well.

# **WORLD OF MAKATON**

The purpose of the World of Makaton website is to introduce more people to this wonderful and easy to learn sign language which supports children and adults who may have learning difficulties and/or delays, to communicate better.

I wanted to keep the site concise and easy to navigate through as there are multiple pages out there that are good as they contain lots of information about the subject but they are not very easy to navigate through and lots of important pieces of information are scattered over several pages.

World of Makaton gives the user a taster of this form of communication and it gives an external pointer to a TV programme which I'd highly recommend as it will help with learning the sign language in form of fun and play.

## **TESTING**


As you can see in my wireframes image below, they layout was originally planned slightly differently, including the position and display of navbar. 

![Wireframes](wireframes/Makaton_wireframe_all.png)

To improve user's experience and ease of navigation on smaller screens, I changed the navbar to be in a fixed position top of the page on every screen. 

I tested every page on iPad and iPhone 8 and asked my friends and family to test the site on their mobile devices (Huawei, Xiaomi Redmi and Samsung) and they confirmed the functionality of all pages and links and were clear on purpose of the website.

I tested the website in Chrome and Microsoft Edge on my desktop PC, and tested it on laptop in Chrome, Mozilla and Microsoft Edge. 

------
info for me: In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part, you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## **VALIDATOR TESTING**

-   HTML (No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator 
    -   [Home page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Famartins87.github.io%2Fworld-of-makaton%2Findex.html)
    -   [About page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Famartins87.github.io%2Fworld-of-makaton%2Fabout.html)
    -   [Abc page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Famartins87.github.io%2Fworld-of-makaton%2Fabc.html) - yellow warning - details in [Unfixed Bugs](https://github.com/AMartins87/world-of-makaton#unfixed-bugs)
    -   [Sign Up page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Famartins87.github.io%2Fworld-of-makaton%2Fsign_up.html)
-   CSS (No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link)

<a></a>
## **UNFIXED BUGS**

-   Yellow warning showed up on the ABC page due to the whole page section not having a heading element. There is no need to use a heading element within the section as the page contains only images of the finger alphabet.

## **CREDITS**

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.


- **Content**
    - My main point of reference for the written content was [Makaton website](https://makaton.org) to double-check I wasn't going to write incorrect data and information.  

    - The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

    - The select option code was advised to use by my mentor Maria Hynes as I couldn't implement a 'required' attribute to my previous checkbox option without using a javascript.

## **BUGS**

-   Right at the beginning my page wasn't loading all the style changes. I realized I forgot to link the style.css file with the index.html file. Once I linked it, all was fixed.

-   When I ran the code through a validator, an error popped up on my sign_up.html page in my '.form-section'. I have had set the target="_blanket" and it had strangely worked - a new page opened up in a new window. However the correct value is target="_blank". 

- When I resized images with TinyJPG, the Lighthouse report came back with low Best Practices, so I reverted to old sizes. All images uploaded well apart from letter F. I deleted and uploaded the image again and retyped the link path to letter F and the issue got fixed.
